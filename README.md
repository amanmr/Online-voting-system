# Online-voting-system
This is an online voting portal where you can register as a user or candidate and can vote a particular candidate.

### There's index.html page which is basically login page.
### A person can register as a Voter or a Candidate
### After login, a HBS page is rendered showing details of the user and list of all the candidates to vote.
### A user can vote only one candidate and the vote count is increased by 1.
### Once voted, it can't be reversed so a confirmation is asked before voting.
